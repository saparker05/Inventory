#### Usage
The program will first present the user with a main menu:

Type c, rs, ss, va, dv, sh or e and press enter to make your selection. 

If ‘Capture shoe data’ is selected the user is prompted to enter the shoe details e.g.

Then this information is stored in the inventory.txt file. 

If ‘Re-stock lowest quantity shoe’ is selected then the user is asked whether to update the stock quantity if they are re-stocking the shoe:

The updated information is stored in the inventory.txt file.

If ‘Search shoes’ is selected then the user is prompted to enter a shoe code:

The information about the shoe is displayed to the user if it exists in the file.

If ‘View all shoes’ is selected then all of the information stored in the inventory.txt file is displayed on the screen:
